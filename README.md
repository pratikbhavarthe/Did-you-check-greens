Welcome to this Next.js project initialized using create-next-app.

I was learning the Next.js tech stack for a company assessment task. After completing the task and finishing a crash course on Next.js, I started working on the project and began implementing Next.js.

## Getting Started

To begin, launch the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the project. You can modify the pages/index.tsx file, and the page will automatically update as you make changes.

API routes are accessible at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. You can customize this endpoint in the pages/api/hello.ts file. Files within the pages/api directory serve as API routes rather than React pages and are mapped to /api/*.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project optimizes and loads the Inter font, a custom Google Font, using next/font.
